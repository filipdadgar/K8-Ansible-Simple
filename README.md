**This playbook installs and configures Containerd and Kubernetes components on all nodes (both master and worker nodes). It then initializes the Kubernetes master (control plane) with the desired API server settings and sets up Flannel CNI. Finally, it joins the worker nodes to the cluster.**

To run the playbook, execute the following command:

```python
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini k8s-setup.yaml
```

# After the playbook finishes, you should have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster with containerd as the container runtime and Flannel as the CNI. The API server should be reachable from the 192.168.0.0/22 subnet. Make sure to copy the /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf file from the master node to your local machine to interact with the cluster using kubectl.
